# Expenses-tracking-app (NOT FINISHED)
App for tracking expenses and incomes.

## Technologies used
Java, Android Studio, git

### How it works
User can make a list of months. He can then go to each month and make a second list. This time it is a list of receipts. 
Each receipt has a label:
- expenses receipt
- income

In each receipt there are two columns. One for one person and one for second person.
User can add costs and incomes to these receipts. Summary will be shown on top of each receipt and will include amount of money one person owes to the other. 

Each receipt and month can be renamed and deleted.
